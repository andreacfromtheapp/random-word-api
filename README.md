# Random Word API

This is my first Rust API with Axum. The proverbial itch to learn API design and
development with Axum.

Its main purpose, besides learning, is to be a simple API to eventually use with
my [Speak and Spell](https://github.com/andreacfromtheapp/elm_speakandspell) toy
project.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by <https://github.com/mcnaveen/random-words-api> (not going to be as
featureful nor publicly usable)

The initial code is based on
[Code Like a Pro in Rust](https://www.manning.com/books/code-like-a-pro-in-rust)
(which I own and have used to learn).
